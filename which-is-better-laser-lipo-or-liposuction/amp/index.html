<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The physician performing the procedure is more important than the technology behind the surgeon. Whether you burn/ damage the fat with a laser before removing it or simply remove it does not matter a bit in my mind.</p><p>Either procedure requires a significant amount of artistry and experience to do well. Most physicians (but not all) currently using the laser are nonsurgeons.</p><p>They were sold the smartlipo machine as a money maker and were told they would have a training session to get them started.</p><p>To me as a plastic surgeon whom has been extensively trained and tested in liposuction, I would consider this dangerous. In my opinion, the company did the consumer a disservice by pushing this technology with exhaustive advertising without real evidence of its efficacy or safety.</p><p>The cart was put well before the horse! (York Jay Yates, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>let’s take a trip back to the origins of liposuction. It was initially introduced to the US by a group of dermatologists, ob-gyns, ENT plastics, and others, not by “board certified plastic surgeons.”</p><p>This is partly because the concept was conceived and invented by ob-gyns and general surgeons in Italy and France, and so was initially discredited by plastic surgeons in this country.</p><p>I say this only in response to the talking points invoked so often by plastic surgeons claiming ownership of this and multiple other procedures.</p><p>Their contributions have been invaluable, yes, but not to the devaluation of those of us who’ve done liposuction since it was introduced into the country, and who have continued to refine the procedure.</p><p>Just as an example, who was it that conceived and developed tumescent anesthesia, the absolute standard of care which as so profoundly enhanced the safety and efficacy of liposuction? A dermatologist named Jeffrey Klein.</p><p>Having done thousands of each procedure—twenty years worth using traditional lipo and ten using laser lipo–I can say without a doubt in my mind that the laser makes the procedure easier on both the patient and operator, and that it enhances skin tightening while minimizing bruising and inflammation.</p><p>I have to monetary reason to promote one versus the other because I haven’t increased my charges since using the laser.</p><p>So my advice is do your research first on available surgeons, and then to be careful about adamant negative comments regarding another method of surgery that they have not personally experienced.</p><p>Seek out a doctor who does traditional lipo and one who does Smartlipo and compare notes and attitudes! Traditional lipo is a great procedure which can do the job well, and Smartlipo adds extra benefit in my opinion.</p><p>But beware of sweeping negative statements by any doctor regarding other specialties or methods. (Robert W. Benson, MD, Hammond Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Laser lipo vs Conventional tumescent lipo</strong></p><p>While the majority of patients will have good results with conventional liposuction because of their skin elasticity there are patients who have decreased skin elasticity and would benefit from the more involved and expensive technique known as laser assisted liposuction (Smart Lipo).</p><p>Finally some patients have such loose skin that even Smart Lipo will not offer enough skin retraction (shrinkage) to provide an acceptable aesthetic result.</p><p>A Board Certified Plastic Surgeon will know which patient will benefit from each of the treatments.</p><p>Laser Lipo is also very useful in cases of revision or ReDo lipo cases. (Harold Bautista, MD, FACS, Fredericksburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>With the advancements in liposuction modalities over the past few years smartlipo has definitely taken over the world of liposculpture.</p><p>The traditional style liposuction as well as vasor liposuction were wonderful modalities utilized to tackle the larger areas of the body such as abdomen and thighs resulting in the older laser assisted smartlipo to be used for the smaller refined areas such as the jawline and axillary folds.</p><p>With the new Smartlipo from Cynosure we have the ability to do away with the older traditional methods due to the increased power and agility of this new liposculpture modality. We now have the ability to tackle larger areas achieving body sculpting along with skin tightening on a level that was not possible with the previous vasor and traditional liposuction options. (Ronald Downs, MD, FACS, South Bend Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Is Laser Lipo better than Traditional Liposculpting</i></p><p>My counsel is to find a cosmetic or plastic surgeon that knows what they are doing and knows how to use their technology properly. I have seen very poor results from Board Certified Plastic Surgeons and amazing results from other specialty training programs that do very fine liposculpting and visa-versa.</p><p>Each technology has some potential benefit as well as draw backs. A wonderful, expensive piece of equipment in the hands of someone without great artistic perspective, good surgical hands and a careful listener will not serve your needs.</p><p>I have been doing liposuction since 2003. What I have learned is that initially Smart Lipo used an under powered laser which was used to up-charge clients because it utilized laser. Since the early days they have increased the laser energy.</p><p>In the proper hands, you can achieve an excellent result but many doctors still have to use ‘regular’ liposuction with Smart Lipo to remove enough fat. If the patient is reasonably lean and requires minimal sculpting Smart Lipo alone may be sufficient.</p><p>People who use only traditional non-power assisted liposuction can over or under treat as well. It is not the equipment one chooses but if they use it safely and effectively. Finally, ALL doctors are smart.</p><p>Here is what I would ask to find out if they are gifted and have your interest at heart:Who taught you the most about liposuction? What is the best thing you have learned to avoid complications? What do you like best about the equipment you use?What is your favorite part of the procedure? Would you show me photos of your work and what you like about the result?. (LeRoy Yates, MD, FACOG, Davenport OB/GYN)</p><p>I perform both Laser Lipo and traditional liposuction. My decision on which technique to use often depends on patient preference and the amount I need to remove. Since Smart Lipo is done in office under local I usually do smaller cases.</p><p>I definitely think Smart Lipo works better since you also get some skin tightening and it is less traumatic. I think it also depends what generation Smart Lipo machine the surgeon has. The Triplex is the latest machine and probable the best. (Stephen M. Miller, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Many new trends exist for liposuction. Ultimately, you can get wonderful results with any technique, but be careful, because you can also get less than satisfactory results with any technique. Firstly, I would submit to you to try and seek liposuction with a Board Certified plastic surgeon, certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p><p>A good place to start is at surgery.org, the website for The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. Ask your surgeon if they feel they perform their liposuction with smart lipo/laser assistance only or do they also employ some form of ‘true’ liposuction along with it to aspirate the fat.</p><p>Some surgeons will first perform some form of traditional liposuction first and then introduce the smart lipo probe under the skin to try and heat up the skin to try and get better skin contraction.</p><p>The jury is still out….but being investigated. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A common question is which is better – traditional liposuction or laser liposuction. If fact, both procedures are good – it all depends on the desired results, patient’s body composition, and the skill and experience of the surgeon.</p><p>My recommendation is to go to a few consultations and ask to talk to former patients who have undergone either of the procedures. (David Shafer, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>It’s not the wand but the magician using it</em></p><p>It’s not the machine that will give you a better result, it is the artist using the machine. Go with the doctor who has been trained better, has more experience, and has great results. Also, make sure that the doctor you choose can treat your complications as well. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>it depends on the patient and how large of an area that needs to be treated. I prefer LaserLipo for smaller areas that can easily be performed in the office under local anesthesia.</p><p>For larger areas, or multiple areas, I still would suggest traditional liposuction. I would do this in the surgery center under general anesthesia. This allows for one procedure and one recovery. (Keith Hodge, MD, Leawood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As with many procedures, your overall results is much dependent upon who is performing the procedure. We’ve been doing laser liposuction, now with SmartLipo, for years. We find that there is less trauma to the body and less downtime with laser-assisted liposuction.</p><p>Now with the technology that SmartLipo has, a patient has the best opportunity for skin tightening with the laser. The best way to decide is to ask to see before and after photos and pay attention to realistic expectation.</p><p>The other decision making aspect for our patients is the ease of using tumescent anesthesia instead of general anesthesia, as well the extra added benefit that the laser provides along with the liposuction. (Emerico Csepanyi, MD, Newport Beach Physician)</p><p>It is crucial to understand that ALL liposuction procedures currently approved are variations of the same basic technique. The main difference between each is really whether the procedure is done manually or with a mechanical/laser assisted device (ie. “smartlipo”)</p><p>All liposuction performed today involves placement of tumescent fluid (really just a combination of saline + numbing agent (ie. lidocaine) to eliminate pain) followed by the actual liposuction to remove fat. That being said, an experienced surgeon will know whether “plain” liposuction will be enough or whether you have looser skin that could potentially benefit from adding a laser device for additional tightening, or whether a tummy-tuck would be a better option overall.</p><p>In my experience, the skill and experience of the surgeon is more important than any mechanical device, just as the skill of a driver matters more than the type of car that is driven. In the right hands, you will get the best recommendation and will obtain the best results.</p><p>Unfortunately, too many surgeons will try to “upsell” the additional cost of Laserlipo without this being actually necessary. (Reza Tirgari, MD, San Diego Physician)<br>
