<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Do you dream to improve the body and get rid of fat? You are not alone in your desire. The problem is urgent for many today.</p><p>Especially often think about removing excess folds on the body of the fair sex. The most popular and simple method for modeling a figure is liposuction. Its main advantage is efficiency and quick results.</p><h3>How to lose belly fat?</h3><p>People who care about their appearance and health ask themselves this question. They also often have to think about removing excess fat deposits on the buttocks, hips, chin and other parts of the body. After consulting a doctor, a diet is prescribed, but it is not always effective.</p><p>The same can be said about sports, massage, sparing cosmetic procedures. Thanks to liposuction over 30 years ago, unlimited possibilities for creating a new face and body were opened before mankind. It has become the embodiment of a dream for both men and women.</p><p>The procedure has a second name – lipoaspiration. It does not eliminate the cause of obesity, but relieves the unpleasant consequences: excess weight, cellulite. In any case, visible manifestations can be eliminated. And this is the first step to health and beauty.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>First there is the destruction of fat. Then the doctor removes them through a small incision.</p><p>The effect can be seen quickly. This is another advantage that liposuction has. The patient’s testimonies indicate that excess fat is easily removed. For some time, swelling may persist. But at the same time a person is already able to see how his appearance has changed.</p><p>Lipoaspiration is a safe operation for human health. Possible complications are well susceptible to prediction. If you follow the advice of a doctor, you can quickly recover.</p><h3>Precautionary measures:</h3><ul>
<li>Exclusion of physical activity;</li>
<li>Refraining from sunburn;</li>
<li>Proper nutrition.</li>
</ul><h3>Result</h3><p>The effect persists for a long time. After lipoaspiration, the fat cells are not restored. Do you want to forget about them forever? Then you will have to maintain a diet and a healthy level of activity for the rest of your life.</p><h3>Classification by body parts</h3><p><strong>Belly</strong></p><p>More often people turn to the surgeon’s help to remove fat in the near-umbilical area.</p><p>Note! The stretching of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall is one of the reasons for the bulging tummy. That’s why not everyone is ready to have liposuction. If the doctor still agreed, then you can remove fat from the lower abdomen, in the navel area, as well as a rectangular crease under the breast. As a result, the stomach becomes not just flat. You get also an elastic press. So you effortlessly get taut and toned abdomen.</p><p><strong>Thighs</strong></p><p>In one visit, lipolysis on the entire surface of the problem zone is not carried out. Otherwise, the patient risks serious problems. The specialist chooses one zone with which he works:</p><ul>
<li>Inner thighs;</li>
<li>Flank</li>
<li>Outer surfaces, or “riding breeches”.</li>
</ul><p>The latter option is in demand among women. The most significant effect is possible in the second of these zones. As a separate procedure, liposuction of the knees is sometimes considered.</p><p><strong>Buttocks</strong></p><p>Most often, representatives of the fair sex are unhappy with this zone. The area is considered one of the most difficult. Here is the subfascial layer of fat. It lies deep. To form a rounded form, observe the rule of three-dimensionality.</p><p>Patients claim that everything passes almost painlessly. At the end of manipulation, seams are applied. They will be removed after 7 days. At least 3 months will have to wait until the moment when it will be possible to evaluate the final results.</p><p><strong>Arms</strong></p><p>Two popular zones:</p><ul>
<li>Underarm area;</li>
<li>The lateral surface of the shoulders.</li>
</ul><p>Visitors to the clinic may be refused surgery if their skin is not sufficiently elastic.</p><p><strong>Face</strong></p><p>Malo-traumatic zone. It is very in demand today. The work is carried out by the method of tumescent liposuction. Mostly, they affect the cheekbone region. Local anesthesia is used. Microscopic incisions are produced.</p><p>The finest cannulas are used for work. That is why it is almost impossible to notice postoperative scars. Result: cheeks are significantly reduced, the contour of the face becomes expressive.</p><p>Please note that you will have to wear a special mask during the recovery period.</p><p><strong>Chin and neck</strong></p><p>The reason for refusing to conduct lipoaspiration of this zone can be excess skin tissue. They sometimes cause the formation of a second chin. Patients are offered to undergo minimally invasive procedures as an alternative. If they are ineffective, liposuction can be considered.</p><p><strong>Legs</strong></p><p>During the procedure, there is a risk of damaging the blood vessels, in a large number represented in this area. The legs consist, for the most part, of the musculoskeletal framework. It is most difficult to work with the calves of the legs.</p><p>The doctor conducts all manipulations with caution. It is desirable to use a tumescent technique for this area. With its method, the recovery period is shorter, and the amount of bruising is minimal.</p><p><strong>The correct choice of Albuquerque clinic</strong></p><p>Choose attractive options. After that, find among them an institution that is present on the market for at least 3 years. After that, you will have to make a choice in favor of this or that doctor.</p><p>Look at the professional biography of the doctor. It is better if his experience is at least 5 years. A successful choice is a surgeon with a specialization in liposuction.</p><h3>Before And After Photos Of Liposuction Performed By Albuquerque Plastic Surgeons</h3><p>City of Albuquerque, NM ZIP Codes: 87101, 87102, 87103, 87104, 87105, 87106, 87107, 87108, 87109, 87110, 87111, 87112, 87113, 87114, 87115, 87116, 87119, 87120, 87121, 87122, 87123, 87125, 87131, 87151, 87153, 87154, 87158, 87176, 87181, 87184, 87185, 87187, 87190, 87191, 87192, 87193, 87194, 87195, 87196, 87197, 87198, 87199.</p><p><strong>Prices for operation in 2008:</strong></p><ul>
