<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>View successful results of legs liposuction patients who have been treated by best plastic surgeons</p><p>Regular intensive power and cardio workouts plus a correct balanced diet help to correct the problem areas on the legs, for example, knee-skin and cellulosic deposits, the inner and outer sides of the thighs, the breeches and shin area.</p><p>But not everyone can force themselves to be engaged in a fitness club. In this case, liposuction of the legs comes to the rescue. We will talk about it further.</p><h3>Fat deposits on the legs and liposuction</h3><p>Knees are an unpredictable zone in the context of fat accumulation. Their condition does not always depend on the weight of a person.</p><p>With an increase in body weight, the kneecap does not always get fat, and vice versa: you can see slender legs with a fatty knob on the inside of the knee. Physical exercises are not a reliable means for correction of the knees, which is proved by the patients’ feedback.</p><p>The body reluctantly gets rid of fat in such zones. The same can be said about the calves – they do not get enough physical activity either in daily life or during training, so by 25-30 years of age they cover with a layer of surface fat.</p><p>In the case of the things and buttocks, everything can be fixed, but this will be a long way, which not everyone can master. Liposuction of the legs in the things area is complicated by the large area of adipose tissue that needs to be removed.</p><p>As a rule, this is the zone of “riding breeches”, the inside of the thigh, the border between the gluteus muscle and the femur biceps. These areas are “replenished” with fat even with hormonal disorders, not to mention a sedentary lifestyle, unbalanced diet, etc.</p><h3>The essence of leg liposuction</h3><p>Liposuction of the knees is effective in case the patient does not suffer from excess weight. The pumping of fat from a specific area for obesity is not only inconclusive, but also prohibited. Other contraindications to liposuction look like this:</p><ul>
<li>weakened immunity;</li>
<li>underage patients;</li>
<li>pregnancy and lactation;</li>
<li>varicose veins and other vascular diseases;</li>
<li>blood diseases.</li>
</ul><p>The presence of contraindications the doctor on the first reception finds out. He will also appoint the necessary tests for the operation, determine the locations of the incisions through which liposuction will be performed. After the results of the analyzes and contraindications are known, the patient comes to the operation.</p><p>The first thing a doctor does is apply a marking to the area where the liposuction will be performed. Then he treats the skin with an antiseptic. These steps are followed by anesthesia, which can be both local and general. The reviews contain information about the frequent use of general anesthesia.</p><p>The doctor cuts one on each side of the knee. Usually their length does not exceed 4 cm. Through these incisions, fatty tissue will be destroyed. The skin tissue is cut in a natural skin fold, so there will be no visible scar from the operation.</p><h3>Types of legs liposuction</h3><p>If this is ultrasonic liposuction, incisions are not needed – cannulas are inserted at the planned points. Through them comes the drug, which turns fatty tissue into a liquid emulsion. As a rule, all preparations of this class contain adrenaline. The effect of ultrasound has an additional destructive effect on fat cells, after which they are removed with the help of a cannula. Vacuum liposuction of the legs is carried out by the same method, but the fat is pumped out using a special device. It injects negative pressure, due to which the cannula sucks fat from under the skin. This method is also called tumescent.</p><p>There is also laser liposuction. This is an expensive procedure with low traumatization of superficial skin tissue. The laser beam is transported to the subcutaneous space with the help of the finest cannula and heats the fat cells.</p><p>In this case, they are destroyed thermomechanically, but additional heating is in favor of the vessels and surrounding tissues: according to cosmeticians, the procedure stimulates the synthesis of collagen. The melted fatty deposits are pumped through the cannula. Any of the methods of liposuction implies a minor injury to the skin, the introduction of a cannula, a destructive effect on adipocytes, and the subsequent removal of them through the cannula. This surgical liposuction and the effect of it comes at once.</p><h3>Recovery period</h3><p>Most of the reviews indicate a 10-17-day duration of the recovery period. Liposuction of the knees or liposuction of the legs in any other area lasts from 40 minutes to 3 hours. After it, the doctor applies stitches, if there are significant incisions, establishes drainage to exit the wound fluid, bandages the wound and helps the patient to wear compression underwear, which will facilitate a faster recovery.</p><p>The patient can leave the clinic immediately after the procedure. Two weeks or more will be needed to eliminate puffiness. But the independent disappearance of edema will not wait – you need to walk a lot and drink plenty of water. Compression underwear can not be removed. The term of wearing is appointed by the attending physician.</p><p>For 2-3 weeks, sports loads, except for low-intensity walking, are prohibited. It is necessary to create favorable conditions for the healing of scars, and then proceed to supporting procedures.</p><h3>Possible complications</h3><p>Despite the exceptionally favorable outcome of a huge number of operations, there is always a danger. This should not deter the patient, but he must know about the possible consequences. Such an inoffensive leg liposuction at first glance is complicated by the superficial location of fat.</p><p>There are no deep fat deposits on the legs and ankles, so when you insert the cannula there is a risk of damage to the subdermal vascular layer. The veins on the legs are sensitive to long-term vacuum effects, which can prolong the recovery period.</p><p>Excessive pumping out of fat should not be. Especially in those areas where it is not so much. The doctor should remove no more than 60% of fat, otherwise there is a risk of vascular damage or the occurrence of unpleasant phenomena in areas where the skin comes into contact with muscle tissue. About punctures in the popliteal fossa, it should be said that they are dangerous, because there are vessels and nerve fibers.</p><p>A little depends on the patient during the operation. The decisive role is played by the reputation of the clinic, the name of the doctor, feedback on his work. To choose a good surgeon means to protect yourself as much as possible.</p><p>It is not necessary to apply to liposuction when all the methods of correction were unsuccessful. One simple operation can completely change your style and your life – then why wait and exhaust yourself with workout? None of the methods of weight loss will not give the same lasting aesthetic effect, as surgical removal of adipose tissue.</p><h3>Liposuction on legs pics</h3></div>
